"<p>The Login Toboggan module improves the Drupal login system by "

"      <li>Allow users to login immediately.</li>\n"
"      <li>Provide a login form on Access Denied pages for "
"non-logged-in (anonymous) users.</li>\n"
"      <li>The module provides two login block options: One uses "
"JavaScript to display the form within the block immediately upon "
"clicking 'log in'. The other brings the user to a separate page, but "
"returns the user to their original page upon login.</li>\n"
"      <li>Customize the registration form with two e-mail fields to "
"ensure accuracy.</li>\n"
"      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page when using "
"the 'Immediate login' feature.</li>\n"
"      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page upon "
"validation of their e-mail address.</li>\n"
"      <li>Optionally display a user message indicating a successful "

"      </ol>\n"
"      These features may be turned on or off in the Login Toboggan <a "

"Immediate Login' option, you probably should not send the user's "
"password out in the welcome e-mail (also note when the 'Set password & "

"<p>The Login Toboggan module improves the Drupal login system by "

"      <ol>\n"
"      <li>Allow users to login using either their username OR their "
"e-mail address.</li>\n"
"      <li>Allow users to define their own password.</li>\n"

"      <li>Provide a login form on Access Denied pages for "
"non-logged-in (anonymous) users.</li>\n"

"<p>The Login Toboggan module improves the Drupal login system by "

"      <li>Provide a login form on Access Denied pages for "
"non-logged-in (anonymous) users.</li>\n"
"      <li>The module provides two login block options: One uses "

"      <li>Customize the registration form with two e-mail fields to "

"      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page when using "
