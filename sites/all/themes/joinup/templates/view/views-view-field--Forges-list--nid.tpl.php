For single overrides, the  * template is perfectly okay.  *  * Variables available:  * - $view: The view object  * - $field: The field handler object that can process the input  * - $row: The raw SQL result that can be used  * - $output: The processed output that will normally be used.  *  * When fetching output from the $row, this construct should be used:  * $data = $row->{$field->field_alias}  *  * The above will guarantee that you'll always get the correct data,  * regardless of any changes in the aliasing that might happen if  * the view is modified.  */  $nb_fed_proj = isa_toolbox_get_federated_projects_count_from_federated_forge($output);?><?php if ($output): ?>  <div class="field field-comment-statistics-comment-count">    <?php print $nb_fed_proj .
